# Worminator game #Unity3D  

Worminator is a game made in Unity3D, my first attempt to work with Unity3D.    
You are a worm and you can shot fireballs. There are some small turrets that shot in you. You win if you destroy all turrets.

You can play on Windows, Linux and MAC OS X by download [Worminator game](https://github.com/neatudarius/Worminator/tree/master/Build).
